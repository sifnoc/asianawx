See also on web, earthquake information from http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/today.html
following this page
> Most recent earthquakes world-wide (hide)

> This page is frequently updated.
> the most recent (above magnitude 2 for the past few hours, larger magnitudes for the rest of the past day, to limit the number to about 100 per day) are shown below with detail links for each quake.
**We use multiple data sources from all over the world** (currently over 20 different national and international agencies), and prioritize them in the following descending order: national institutes / agencies - USGS - EMSC - GFZ. Where data from different agencies for the same earthquake is available, you can find and compare the often differing data for magnitude, depth etc. in the detail page for each quake. 
As a new feature, when updates are available, **you will be notified to reload the page from the server** (or use F5 key / Shift-Reload). You can also opt for the page to automatically update.

They handle earthquake data get from almost 20 difference sources each countries.
But its not automatically update(not ajax?) something and could not the earthquake happen how far from our Active airport.
